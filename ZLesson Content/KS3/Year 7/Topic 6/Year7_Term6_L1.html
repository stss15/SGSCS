<p class="p2">Lesson 1: Why Binary? An Introduction to Number Systems</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Imagine that every time you press a button on your computer, it sends a secret message made up of only two symbols. It might sound a bit like magic at first, but that is exactly how computers communicate! In our everyday world, we use many different number systems, but computers rely on a very simple one: the binary system. In binary, everything is expressed using just two numbers: 0 and 1. Today, we’re going to explore the exciting world of number systems and learn a new skill—converting the numbers you use every day (denary) into binary form.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">────────────────────────────</p>
<p class="p2">The Power of On and Off</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Think of the light switch in your home. When you flip the switch up, the light turns on, and when you flip it down, the light turns off. In the world of computers, “on” is like the number 1 and “off” is like the number 0. Inside every computer, millions of tiny switches work together in this very simple way. Each switch can only have one of two states: on (1) or off (0). Although it might seem very basic, this simple on/off system is the secret behind everything your computer does—from displaying colourful pictures to playing your favourite music.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Just like a room full of light switches that together can create patterns of brightness and darkness, these little binary digits combine to form more complex ideas. Each group of 0s and 1s is a bit of information, and by stringing them together, computers can represent numbers, letters, images, and even sounds.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">────────────────────────────</p>
<p class="p2">Number Systems: Denary versus Binary</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">In your day-to-day life, you use the denary system (also known as the decimal system) without even thinking about it. This system is based on ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. For example, the number 251 means two hundreds, five tens, and one unit. This is because each digit’s place value is a power of 10.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">On the other hand, the binary system is based on only two digits: 0 and 1. Instead of using powers of 10, binary uses powers of 2. Every position in a binary number represents a specific power of 2, starting with 2⁰ on the right (which equals 1) and increasing as you move to the left. This simple system is what gives computers their remarkable power and speed.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">────────────────────────────</p>
<p class="p2">Converting Denary to Binary: A Step-by-Step Guide</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">While it may seem a bit tricky at first, converting a denary (decimal) number to binary is like following a fun recipe. We’re going to use the repeated division method to change a number you use every day into its binary form. Let’s break it down step by step.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>1.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Start with a Denary Number:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p4">Imagine you have the number 156. This is a denary number that we use in everyday math.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>2.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Divide by 2 and Record the Remainder:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p4">To convert 156 to binary, you first divide 156 by 2.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>156 ÷ 2 = 78 with a remainder of 0.</p>
<p class="p5">This remainder (0) is the first binary digit (the least significant bit).</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Repeat the Division:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p4">Now, take the quotient and divide by 2 again.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>78 ÷ 2 = 39 with a remainder of 0.</p>
<p class="p5">Write down this remainder (0).</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>4.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Continue Until You Reach 0:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p4">Keep dividing the new quotient by 2 until the quotient becomes 0. For our number, the process looks like this:</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>39 ÷ 2 = 19 with a remainder of 1.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>19 ÷ 2 = 9 with a remainder of 1.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>9 ÷ 2 = 4 with a remainder of 1.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>4 ÷ 2 = 2 with a remainder of 0.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>2 ÷ 2 = 1 with a remainder of 0.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>1 ÷ 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>5.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Write the Binary Number:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p4">Now, take all the remainders you’ve recorded. They are read from the last remainder to the first: 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0. So, 156 in denary is written as 10011100 in binary.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">This process might seem a bit like solving a puzzle at first, but with practice it becomes as natural as counting with your fingers. Every time you perform this conversion, you are learning the secret language of computers!</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">────────────────────────────</p>
<p class="p4">A Fun “Did You Know?” Section</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Did you know that number systems can be found in surprising places in everyday life? For example, in some countries, people sometimes measure weight using both pounds (lbs) and stones. A stone is equal to 14 pounds—a base-14 system of sorts! This shows that while our daily life mostly uses the base-10 system, other cultures and systems can work with completely different bases.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Also, here’s a fun fact about our calendar: the word “decimal” comes from the Latin word for “ten,” which is why our everyday counting system is based on ten digits. But have you ever wondered why December, which we now think of as the twelfth month, used to be the tenth month of the year? In the old Roman calendar, the year began in March, making December the tenth month! As time went on and calendars changed, we kept the name December, even though its position in the year shifted. Isn’t it interesting how numbers and history mix together?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">────────────────────────────</p>
<p class="p4">Why Converting Denary to Binary Matters</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Understanding how to convert numbers from the denary system to binary is like unlocking a secret code. By learning this skill, you can start to appreciate how computers use a series of on and off signals (the 0s and 1s) to build everything from simple calculations to the stunning graphics on a video game screen. When you grasp this conversion process, you begin to see the beauty in what may seem like simple arithmetic.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Remember, every time you use your computer, play a game, or even just look at a digital clock, the device is working with binary numbers deep inside its circuits. Converting denary to binary isn’t just an exercise in math—it is a window into the digital world that powers our modern lives.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">────────────────────────────</p>
<p class="p4">Everyday Applications of Binary</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Consider your favourite video game. Every move you make and every jump your character takes is calculated using binary numbers. Computers translate the instructions you give into binary, and then process these instructions at incredible speed. Even simple tasks like sending a text message involve binary data being switched on and off in a carefully controlled sequence.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Digital photography is another area where binary is at work. When you take a picture, your camera converts the light captured by its sensor into binary code. This code then creates the image you see on your screen. Understanding binary gives you a glimpse into how these everyday marvels are possible.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">────────────────────────────</p>
<p class="p4">Breaking Down the Conversion Process with a Simple Example</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Let’s try converting another familiar number—say, 37—into binary using our step-by-step method. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>1.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Divide 37 by 2:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>37 ÷ 2 = 18 with a remainder of 1.</p>
<p class="p5">Record the 1.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>2.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Divide 18 by 2:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>18 ÷ 2 = 9 with a remainder of 0.</p>
<p class="p5">Record the 0.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Divide 9 by 2:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>9 ÷ 2 = 4 with a remainder of 1.</p>
<p class="p5">Record the 1.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>4.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Divide 4 by 2:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>4 ÷ 2 = 2 with a remainder of 0.</p>
<p class="p5">Record the 0.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>5.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Divide 2 by 2:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>2 ÷ 2 = 1 with a remainder of 0.</p>
<p class="p5">Record the 0.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>6.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Divide 1 by 2:</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>1 ÷ 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1.</p>
<p class="p5">Record the 1.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Now, read the remainders from bottom to top: 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1. This means 37 in denary is 100101 in binary. Notice how the repeated division neatly breaks the number into a pattern of 0s and 1s that a computer understands perfectly.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p5">────────────────────────────</p>
<p class="p5">The Magic Behind Simple Calculations</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p5">You might wonder why this process of converting numbers matters. Well, think of it like learning a new language—a language that your computer speaks. Every time you convert a familiar denary number into binary, you are practising the syntax of this digital language. The more you practise, the easier it becomes to understand not just how computers store information, but also how they perform calculations and execute programs.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Just like learning to speak another language helps you communicate with people from different parts of the world, understanding binary opens the door to understanding technology on a deeper level. It is the first step in your journey toward exploring how computers truly work.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p5">────────────────────────────</p>
<p class="p5">A Quick Recap of What We’ve Learned</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Let’s take a moment to review the key points of today’s lesson:</p>
<p class="p5">• We discovered that computers use binary—a system made up of only 0s and 1s—to operate.</p>
<p class="p5">• We learned that our everyday denary system is based on ten digits, while binary is based on powers of 2.</p>
<p class="p5">• We practiced converting a denary number (like 156 or 37) into binary using a simple repeated division method.</p>
<p class="p5">• We found out some fun facts about number systems: did you know that weight measurements like stones and pounds work in an unusual base (with 14 pounds in a stone) and that December originally was the 10th month in the Roman calendar?</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
