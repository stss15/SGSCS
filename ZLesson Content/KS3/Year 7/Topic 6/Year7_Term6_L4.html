<p class="p1"><b>Chapter 4: Representing Text – From Characters to Binary</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Welcome back, digital detectives! In the previous chapters, you learned how computers speak a language made up of only 0s and 1s (binary) and discovered a secret shortcut called hexadecimal that helps us understand long strings of binary numbers. Now, we’re going to dive into a new adventure—how do computers understand the words, letters, and symbols that we use every day? In this chapter, we’ll explore how text is represented in a computer and how our favorite characters are turned into binary code.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">⸻</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Recap: The World of 0s, 1s, and Hex</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Before we begin, let’s quickly remember what we’ve discovered so far:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>Binary Basics:</b></span> Every piece of data in a computer—numbers, images, sounds—is stored as a sequence of 0s and 1s. These bits are like tiny switches that are either off (0) or on (1).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>Hexadecimal Magic:</b></span> We learned that hexadecimal (or “hex” for short) is a way to write binary numbers more neatly by grouping four bits into one symbol. This makes reading long binary strings much easier.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Now that you’re comfortable with these ideas, let’s see how computers use these same 0s and 1s to represent text!</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">⸻</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>The Secret Code Behind Letters and Symbols</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>What Is Text, Anyway?</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">When you type a letter on a keyboard or read a story on a screen, you’re seeing text. But how does a computer “know” what the letter A or the number 5 means? The answer is that every character is given a special code. Just like every superhero has a secret identity, every letter, number, and symbol has its own secret code in a computer’s language!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>Character Sets: The Codebooks for Computers</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Imagine you have a huge library where each book is a special code that tells the computer what to display. This library is called a <span class="s1"><b>character set</b></span>. There are two main character sets we’ll talk about:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>1.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>What It Is:</b></span> ASCII is one of the earliest systems created to give every character a unique number.</p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>How It Works:</b></span> In ASCII, every letter, number, and symbol is represented by a 7‑bit binary number—that means a number made up of 7 digits that are either 0 or 1. For example, the uppercase letter “A” might be given a code like 01000001.</p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>Why It’s Useful:</b></span> Because every computer understands ASCII, when you type a letter, the computer can convert that letter into its binary code and then work with it.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>2.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>Unicode: The Global Superhero of Text</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>What It Is:</b></span> Unicode is like an upgraded version of ASCII. It’s designed to include not just English letters and common symbols, but characters from almost every language in the world—and even fun emojis!</p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>How It Works:</b></span> Unlike ASCII, which uses 7 or 8 bits per character, Unicode can use 16 or even 32 bits. That means it can cover thousands of characters!</p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>Why It’s Important:</b></span> With Unicode, computers can display texts in languages like Chinese, Arabic, Russian, and many others—all using the same system.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>How Do Characters Turn Into Binary?</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Imagine you want to write the word “HELLO” on your computer. Behind the scenes, your computer looks up each letter in its secret codebook (the character set). For instance, it might find:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>H</b></span> → 01001000</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>E</b></span> → 01000101</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>L</b></span> → 01001100</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>L</b></span> → 01001100</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1"><b>O</b></span> → 01001111</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Then, the computer stores and processes these strings of 0s and 1s. When it’s time to show you the word “HELLO” on the screen, it simply translates the binary codes back into letters!</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">⸻</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Why Do We Need Standard Codes?</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>The Power of a Common Language</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Imagine if every country had its own language for writing numbers. If you tried to send a letter to a friend in another country, you might never understand each other! In computers, having a standard character set (like ASCII or Unicode) means that every computer, no matter where it is in the world, can understand the same code. This is like everyone agreeing to speak one common language.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>Consistency and Communication</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Because every computer uses the same codes for letters and symbols, when you send a message from one computer to another, the text stays the same. For example, if you send an email saying “Hello!” using Unicode, your friend’s computer will correctly display “Hello!” even if it uses a different operating system or is in another country.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>Fun Fact: The Magic of Emojis</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Thanks to Unicode, you can now send your friends smiley faces 😊, thumbs up 👍, and even wacky faces 🤪! These emojis have their own unique binary codes, just like letters do. So, when you tap on an emoji, your device is secretly turning that smiley into a special code that every computer understands.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">⸻</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Bringing It All Together</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>A Day in the Life of Text</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Let’s imagine you’re writing a story on your tablet. Every time you press a key, your device quickly translates that letter into a binary code using the character set it supports. Then, when you’re finished, the computer saves your story as a long file filled with 0s and 1s. Later, when you open the file, the computer reverses the process—converting the binary codes back into the characters that you see as text.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>Real-World Example: The Digital Library</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Think of your favorite library, filled with books in many languages. Now imagine that each book isn’t written with ink on paper but as a series of 0s and 1s on a computer. The character set (ASCII or Unicode) is like the library’s catalog system, making sure that every book is labeled correctly so that readers around the world can find and read it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>How Does This Help Us?</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">By understanding how text is represented in binary:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>We learn how computers read and write text.</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>We can appreciate the clever ways that thousands of characters from different languages are organized into neat, logical codes.</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>We begin to see how digital communication is possible.</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>We unlock the secret behind every message, email, or story we read online.</b><b></b></p>
